This is a landing page for a safari booking website called Camper.

I used a couple of images from unsplash.com and pexels.com by the following
wonderful artists; Yolandie Conradie, Brian Kungu, Charl Durand and MCK.

# Html File
- Added alt attributes to all images for better accessibility.
- Updated the navigation links by adding href attributes.
- Added a class to style the call to action button separately.
- Added a new section with the title "Dream Destinations."
- Combined the examples and destinations into a single gallery section.
- Updated the structure to support a scrolling gallery.
- Added links to the footer for better navigation.

# CSS File
- Added styles for the new dream-destinations section.
- Implemented a horizontal scroll for the gallery with flexbox.
- Adjusted individual item styles within the gallery to ensure consistent layout and appearance.
